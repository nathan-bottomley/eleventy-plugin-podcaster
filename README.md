`eleventy-plugin-podcaster` ‚Äî¬†or **Podcaster**, as we¬†will call it from now on ‚Äî lets you use Eleventy to create a podcast and its accompanying website. **Podcaster** creates the podcast feed that you submit to Apple Podcasts, Spotify or any other podcast directory. **Podcaster** also provides information about your podcast to your Eleventy templates so that you can create the pages for your podcast's website ‚Äî pages for individual episodes, guests, topics, seasons or anything else at all.

Plenty of services exist that will host your podcast online ‚Äî [Spotify][], [Acast][], [Podbean][], [Buzzsprout][], [Blubrry][]. But none of these will allow you to own your podcast's presence on the web, and none of them will give you the freedom to create a site that presents your podcast in a way that reflects its tone, style and branding.

But **Podcaster** will.

## Installation

To install the npm package, type this at the command line:

```shell
npm install eleventy-plugin-podcaster
```

And then include the plugin in your Eleventy configuration file.

```js
// eleventy.config.js

import podcaster from 'eleventy-plugin-podcaster'

export default function (eleventyConfig) {
  .
  .
  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(podcaster)
  .
  .
}
```

## Podcast information

Once you've installed **Podcaster** in your Eleventy project, the next step is to provide it with information about your podcast ‚Äî¬†the title, the owner, the category, the subcategory and so on. The easiest way to do this is to put all the information in your data directory in a `podcast.json` file.

Here's an example.

```json
{
  "title": "Flight Through Entirety: A Doctor Who Podcast",
  "description": "Flying through the entirety of Doctor Who. Originally with cake, but now with guests.",
  "siteUrl": "https://flightthroughentirety.com",
  "author": "Flight Through Entirety",
  "category": "TV & Film",
  "language": "en-AU",
}
```

## Episode information

For each podcast episode you create, you will also create a Eleventy template containing the information about it ‚Äî¬†the title, the release date, the episode number, the filename and so on. This template will have the tag `podcastEpisode`; its front matter will contain all of the information about the episode ‚Äî title, release date, episode number and so on ‚Äî and its content will contain the episode's show notes.

Here's an example.

```yaml
---
title: Entering a new Phase
date: 2024-04-14
tags:
  - podcastEpisode
episode:
  filename: 500YD S1E1, Entering a New Phase.mp3
  seasonNumber: 1
  episodeNumber: 1
---
A big week for beginnings this week, with a new Doctor, a new origin story for the Daleks, and a whole new approach to defeating the bad guys. Oh, and a new podcast to discuss them all on. So let's welcome Patrick Troughton to the studio floor, as we discuss _The Power of the Daleks_.

```

## Episode files

Your podcast episode files will be audio files ‚Äî¬†MP3s, usually. You will normally put these in an `/episodes` folder at the top level of your project.

For each of your podcast episode files, **Podcaster** needs three important pieces of information: the filename, the size in bytes and the duration. You can provide this information in [your episode templates' front matter](docs/episode-information.md), but **Podcaster** can calculate the size and duration for you, depending on how your project is set up.

[Read more about calculating episode size and duration.](size-and-duration.md)

## The podcast feed

To create your podcast feed, **Podcaster** needs both the information you've provided about your podcast and the information you've provided about your individual episodes.

By default, your podcast feed will be located at `/feed/podcast.xml`, which means that the URL you submit to Apple Podcasts or Spotify (or wherever) will be `{{ podcast.siteUrl }}/feed/podcast.xml`

## Using podcast information and episode information in templates

All the podcast and episode information you provide are made available to your templates through the data cascade, including `title`, `date` and `excerpt`, as well as fields on the `podcast` and `episode` objects.

Here's how you could use this information to describe a single podcast episode in a Liquid template.

```liquid
<article>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <div class="episode-number">Episode {{ episode.episodeNumber }}</div>
  <div class="release-date">{{ date | date: "%A %-e %B %Y" }}</div>
  <section class="content">
    {{ content }}
  </section>
  <audio controls src="{{ episode.url }}" preload="none">
  <p class="audio-details">
    Episode {{ episode.episodeNumber }}: {{ title }}
    | Recorded on {{ recording_date | date: "%A %-e %B %Y" }}
    | Duration {{ episode.duration }}
    | <a download href="{{ episode.url }}">Download</a>
  </p>
</article>
```

All podcast episode templates belong to the `collections.podcastEpisode` collection, which means you can list several episodes on a single page using [Eleventy's pagination feature][pagination]. In that case, each episode's  information will be available its [collection item data structure][item].

[item]: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/#collection-item-data-structure

## Hosting your podcast

**Podcaster** works well when you deploy your podcast website using one of the two most common methods for deploying an Eleventy website:

1. uploading your output directory (usually `_site`) to a web host
2. linking your GitHub repository to [one of the Jamstack providers listed in the Eleventy documentation][jamstack]

[jamstack]: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/deployment/#jamstack-providers

### 1. Uploading your output directory to a web host

If you upload your output directory to a web host, you might be able to host your podcast episode files as part of your site, perhaps in an `/episodes` subdirectory.

### 2. Linking your GitHub repository to a Jamstack provider

If you link your GitHub repository to a Jamstack provider, or if you don't want to host your podcast episode files as part of your site, you need to host them somewhere where they each get assigned a public URL. And if your podcast has a large international audience, it should also be somewhere where they can be served by a content delivery network.

This might be the most complicated part of setting up a podcast website. [Read on for information about hosting your podcast.](docs/hosting.md)

## Optional features

**Podcaster** also implements some optional features which are useful for creating podcast websites ‚Äî **drafts** and **excerpts**.

## Podcaster in action

I started podcasting and creating podcasting websites in 2014. At first I used Squarespace, then WordPress, then Jekyll, before finally settling on Eleventy late in 2022.

I now have seven podcast websites powered by Eleventy, and **Podcaster** was derived from the code I used to create them and is now being used to support them all.

Here's a list of them:

- [Flight Through Entirety](https://flightthroughentirety.com), a _Doctor Who_ podcast flying through the entirety of the show's 60-something-year history.
- [Untitled Star Trek Project](https://untitledstartrekproject.com), a _Star Trek_ commentary podcast, where two friends watch _Star Trek_ episodes from across the franchise, chosen (nearly) at random using [a page on the podcast website](https://untitledstartrekproject.com/randomiser).
- [500 Year Diary](https://500yeardiary), another _Doctor Who_ podcast, where we look at the show's themes and ideas and some of the people involved in its creation.
- [The Second Great and Bountiful Human Empire](https://thesecondgreatandbountifulhumanempire.com), a _Doctor Who_ flashcast, where we give our initial reactions to each episode of the post-2023 era of the show.
- [Startling Barbara Bain](https://startlingbarbarabain), a commentary podcast on _Space: 1999_, a lavish and generally ridiculous British scifi show from the 1970s.
- [Maximum Power](https://maximumpowerpodcast.com), a podcast about _Blakes 7_, a less lavish but more ridiculous British scifi show from the 1970s.
- [Bondfinger](https://bondfinger.com), a James Bond commentary podcast that soon ran out of James Bond films and ended up spending its time drinking and watching terrible TV shows from the 1960s.
