# eleventy-plugin-podcaster 🕚⚡️🎈🐀🎤📲

`eleventy-plugin-podcaster` — or **Podcaster**, as we will call it from now on — lets you use Eleventy to create a podcast and its accompanying website. **Podcaster** creates the podcast feed that you submit to Apple Podcasts, Spotify or any other podcast directory. And it provides information about your podcast to your Eleventy templates. This means that you can include information about the podcast and its episodes on your podcast's website, creating pages for individual episodes, guests, topics, seasons or anything else at all.

Plenty of services exist that will host your podcast online — [Spotify][], [Acast][], [Podbean][], [Buzzsprout][], [Blubrry][]. But none of these will allow you to own your podcast's presence on the web, and none of them will give you the freedom to create a site that presents your podcast in a way that reflects its premise, tone and style.

But **Podcaster** will.

[Acast]: https://www.acast.com
[Podbean]: https://www.podbean.com
[Buzzsprout]: https://www.buzzsprout.com
[Blubrry]: https://blubrry.com

## Installation

To install the npm package, type this at the command line:

```shell
npm install eleventy-plugin-podcaster
```

And then include the plugin in your Eleventy configuration file.

```js
// eleventy.config.js

import podcaster from 'eleventy-plugin-podcaster'

export default function (eleventyConfig) {
  .
  .
  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(podcaster)
  .
  .
}
```

## Podcast information

Once you've installed **Podcaster** in your Eleventy project, the next step is to provide it with information about your podcast — the title, the owner, the category, the subcategory and so on. The easiest way to do this is to put all the information in your data directory in a `podcast.json` file.

Here's an example.

```json
{
  "title": "Flight Through Entirety: A Doctor Who Podcast",
  "description": "Flying through the entirety of Doctor Who. Originally with cake, but now with guests.",
  "siteUrl": "https://flightthroughentirety.com",
  "author": "Flight Through Entirety",
  "category": "TV & Film",
  "language": "en-AU",
}
```

## Episode information

For each podcast episode you create, you will also create a Eleventy template containing the information about it — the title, the release date, the episode number, the filename and so on. This template will have the tag `podcastEpisode`; its front matter will contain all of the information about the episode — title, release date, episode number and so on — and its content will contain the episode's show notes.

Here's an example.

```yaml
---
title: Entering a new Phase
date: 2024-04-14
tags:
  - podcastEpisode
episode:
  filename: 500YD S1E1, Entering a New Phase.mp3
  seasonNumber: 1
  episodeNumber: 1
  size: 61231442 # bytes
  duration: "1:02:58"
---
A big week for beginnings this week, with a new Doctor, a new origin story for the Daleks, and a whole new approach to defeating the bad guys. Oh, and a new podcast to discuss them all on. So let's welcome Patrick Troughton to the studio floor, as we discuss _The Power of the Daleks_.

## The podcast feed

To create your podcast feed, **Podcaster** needs both the information you've provided about your podcast and the information you've provided about your individual episodes.

By default, your podcast feed will be located at `/feed/podcast.xml`, which means that the URL you submit to Apple Podcasts or Spotify (or wherever) will be `{{ podcast.siteUrl }}/feed/podcast.xml`

## Using podcast information and episode information in templates

All the podcast and episode information you provide are made available to your templates through the data cascade, including `title`, `date` and `excerpt`, as well as fields in the `podcast` and `episode` objects.

Here's how you could use this information to describe a single podcast episode in a Liquid template.

```liquid
<article>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <div class="episode-number">Episode {{ episode.episodeNumber }}</div>
  <div class="release-date">{{ date | date: "%A %-e %B %Y" }}</div>
  <section class="content">
    {{ content }}
  </section>
  <audio controls src="{{ episode.url }}" preload="none">
  <p class="audio-details">
    Episode {{ episode.episodeNumber }}: {{ title }}
    | Recorded on {{ recording_date | date: "%A %-e %B %Y" }}
    | Duration {{ episode.duration }}
    | <a download href="{{ episode.url }}">Download</a>
  </p>
</article>
```

All podcast episode templates belong to the `collections.podcastEpisode` collection, which means you can list several episodes on a single page using [Eleventy's pagination feature][pagination]. In that case, each episode's  information will be available in its [collection item data structure][item].

[item]: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/#collection-item-data-structure

## Hosting your episode files

**Podcaster** assumes that all your episode audio files are stored in an `/episodes` directory at the top level of your project.

But it works equally well if they aren't. In fact, you probably won't want to host your episode audio files alongside your podcast website. The files will be too big to fit in your repository, for one thing. And they will probably be quicker for your listeners to download if they are stored on some kind of CDN or on some kind of dedicated storage.

To find out how to set this up and how to make this work with **Podcaster**, [read more about hosting your episode files][hosting].

## Optional features

**Podcaster** also implements some optional features which are useful for creating podcast websites — **drafts** and **excerpts**.

These are not fundamental features of a podcast website, which is why they are opt-in. You activate them by passing options to the `addPlugin` method in your configuration file.

```js
    eleventyConfig.addPlugin(podcaster, {
      handleDrafts: true,
      handleExcerpts: true
    })
```

## Podcaster in action

I started podcasting and creating podcasting websites in 2014. At first I used Squarespace, then WordPress, then Jekyll, before finally settling on Eleventy late in 2022.

I now have seven podcast websites powered by Eleventy, and **Podcaster** was derived from the code I used to create them and is now being used to support all but one of them.

Here's a list:

- [Flight Through Entirety](https://flightthroughentirety.com), a _Doctor Who_ podcast flying through the entirety of the show's 60-something-year history.
- [Untitled Star Trek Project](https://untitledstartrekproject.com), a _Star Trek_ commentary podcast, where two friends watch _Star Trek_ episodes from across the franchise, chosen (nearly) at random using [a page on the podcast website](https://untitledstartrekproject.com/randomiser).
- [500 Year Diary](https://500yeardiary), another _Doctor Who_ podcast, where we look at the show's themes and ideas and some of the people involved in its creation.
- [The Second Great and Bountiful Human Empire](https://thesecondgreatandbountifulhumanempire.com), a _Doctor Who_ flashcast, where we give our initial reactions to each episode of the post-2023 era of the show.
- [Startling Barbara Bain](https://startlingbarbarabain), a commentary podcast on _Space: 1999_, a lavish and generally ridiculous British scifi show from the 1970s.
- [Maximum Power](https://maximumpowerpodcast.com), a podcast about _Blakes 7_, a less lavish but more ridiculous British scifi show from the 1970s.
- [Bondfinger](https://bondfinger.com), a James Bond commentary podcast that soon ran out of James Bond films and ended up spending its time drinking and watching terrible TV shows from the 1960s.
